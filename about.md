I am a professional data scientist for Itron, a global energy resource management company, working out of an office in downtown Denver, Colorado. My career truly began around age 10, when I decided I was going to be an actuary. This goal persisted into my college career, leading me to major in statistics at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, CA. During my time here, I passed the first actuarial exam but decided that a career in statistical consulting seemed much more appealing. This change of heart persuaded me to pursue a graduate degree in statistics at UC Santa Barbara. Upon returning home to Denver in 2015, I began working as a statistician and enjoyed my projects and working to help patients a great deal. However, I grew suspicious of the trustworthiness of inferential analyses and began hungering for work in predictive analytics. I began studying machine learning techniques beyond regression and was lucky enough to be hired as a junior data scientist for a demand response software company quickly acquired by Itron.

During my free time, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, meditation, yoga, reading, cooking, playing with my cat and spending time with my family and friends.
