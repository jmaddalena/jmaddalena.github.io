![Me](/images/julia_piano.jpg){: .center-image }

I am a data scientist for zData working remotely from my home in Fort Collins, CO. A childhood desire to become an actuary led me to major in statistics at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, CA. During my time there, I passed the first actuarial exam but decided that a career in statistical consulting seemed much more appealing. This change of heart persuaded me to pursue a graduate degree in statistics at UC Santa Barbara. 

Upon returning home to Denver in 2015, I began working as a statistician and enjoyed my projects and working to help patients. However, I grew suspicious of the trustworthiness of inferential analyses and began hungering for work in predictive analytics. I studied advanced machine learning techniques on the side and was lucky enough to be hired as a data scientist for a demand response software company called Comverge (now Itron) before transitioning to data science consulting with Miner & Kasch (later zData) in early 2019. 

I began hungering to put my data science skills to work for the greater good and was particularly excited about both carbon tech and agritech. After a patient job search in the first half of 2021, I landed a job as Senior Data Scientist for Cloud Agronomics (now Perennial) and have been working on prediction of soil carbon using satellite imagery and machine learning ever since. 

During my free time, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, meditation, yoga, reading, gardening, cooking, sewing, watercoloring, playing piano and ukulele, and spending time with my family and friends. I am always striving to improve myself and constantly eager to learn new things, something that shapes a large part of my personality!
