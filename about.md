![Me](/images/julia_cb_2.jpg){: .center-image }

I am a statistician turned data scientist with a background that spans healthcare, energy, consulting, and carbon markets. I am passionate about using machine learning to help build technologies working to mitigate climate change and increase sustainability. I subscribe deeply to the philosophy that we should transition to a circular economy to protect existing biodiversity on this planet and leave a better Earth for those who come after us. 

I believe one of my greatest strengths is my ability to tell compelling stories about data through narrative and data visualization. I demonstrate some of my data storytelling efforts on this blog - I hope you enjoy! 

Outside of work, I have many hobbies, including cooking, gardening, permaculture, yoga, hiking, rock climbing, sewing. I have also recently taken to writing, recording and performing music building off my many years of singing and playing piano and ukulele.
