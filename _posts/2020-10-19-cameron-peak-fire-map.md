During a particular dry summer, a fire of unknown origin began burning on August 13, 2020 near Chambers Lake, Colorado, roughly 60 miles from my house. It quickly became the largest wildfire in Colorado history, burning a total of 208,663 acres (236 square miles) before being fully contained on December 3. While we didn't always notice the fire, on some days the sky turned dark orange, ash and burned pine needles rained from the sky, and very little time could be spent outside.

The fires were the talk of the town. One day, we would hear "Red Feather Lakes is in danger" and a few weeks later: "Supposedly Estes Park is going to be evacuated". I could not get a sense for how this fire was moving, and the [existing progression maps](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=821eb2bac47c48c69558075f21365f01) were unintuitive for understanding the movement of the fire. 

I decided I was going to try to find a way to collect up-to-date information on the fire's progression and use it to animate the fire's progression, if possible. This blog summarizes my approach to finding and altering the data, and using ggplot and few of its related libraries to generate the animation below.
