During my time on the bench at work in the summer of 2019, I spent a lot of time teaching myself the principles of reinforcement learning and distilling them down into a one hour talk. You can find the slides for my presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rq8YbQnu0C7oGOgWiPHPaz-nw069F5CB/edit#slide=id.p30). This presentation assumes a basic knowledge of neural networks.

You can also find a recording [here](https://youtu.be/NbPVx8k0lpk) of the first of many times I gave this talk. It gets off to a slow start but stick with it and I'm sure you will learn a lot more from the presentation than from the slides alone!
